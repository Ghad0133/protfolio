# protfolio

## Background (How you created your we protoflio)

 The way I made my protfolio is from scratch. I was intimated by the 11000 lines of code I would have to edit in bootstrap. I wish I could have combined 2 ways to website make my website better.

### challenges faced 

1. The biggest challange i faced was trying to orginaize "My Work" page

2. A really big challange was time.

3. Trying to get other assignmments done

### how did I over come these challenges

1. "My Work" page still looks bad and i did what i could but i added another set of buttons under the projects so it would not be on the same line as my projects. i also added a seperate set of buttons for my desktop so it wouldn't mess with my mobile mockup and I just had to add display none so i didn't have two sets of buttons.

2. A few sleepless nights and a few days off of work it was i had to do to get this done.

3. I had to drop some other assignmets to get this done but i had a pretty good grade in the class I had to drop the assignmet for so I don't think is will effect mt grade to hard

## what i learned 

one thing i did learn is to make an underline go away from a link i had to use " a:link{text-decoration: none;}. I thought i had call the 
class and put text-decoration none. One more thing i learned is when the html validator says bogus comment it just means u have to re-enter your dashes. Other than that i didn't really learn anything.
